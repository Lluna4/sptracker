    <h1>stracker and ptracker</h1>
    <p class="lead"><i>stracker</i> and <i>ptracker</i> are apps for the race simulator 
    <a href=http://www.assettocorsa.net>Assetto Corsa</a>. </p><p><i>stracker</i> is the server-side 
    portion and <i>ptracker</i> is for the client side (i.e., it runs in the game). Both apps 
    aim to improve your online experience. It is not required to always have both instances 
    running - <i>stracker</i> can be used without all drivers using <i>ptracker</i> and vice 
    versa. However, you get the best experience when both are running.
    <h2>ptracker</h2>
    <h3>Main Window</h3>
    <p>The client app provides a window in the game with 3 sections: The hotlap section, 
    the leaderboard section and the message section. Each section is highly customizable,
    you decide about the information displayed on your screen.</p>

    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>The <b>hotlap section</b> shows information about the current lap. The hotlap line is 
            shown here in its default configuration:<br><br>
            <img src="images/ptracker-screen-2.png" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Responsive image">
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Live delta / lap time / pit time display</li>
                <li>Lap validness display (green: lap valid, red: lap invalid)</li>
                <li>Split delta</li>
                <li>Sector delta</li>
                <li>Connection status (gray: not connected, green: stracker connection established, yellow: setup available for download)</li>
                <li>Session progress (qualification/practice: time left, race: &lt;current lap&gt;/&lt;number of laps&gt;)</li>
                <li>Fuel indicator (gray: fuel for more than 3 laps left, yellow: fuel for 1 to 3 laps left, blinking: less than 1 lap left)</li>
                <li>Fuel prediction (number of laps left). ('-' if no fuel prediction is available)</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The <b>leaderboard section</b> shows the current leaderboard with current rank, car badge,
        tyre, name, relative deltas, best lap times and more.</li>
        <li>The <b>message section</b> shows chat messages and messages from ptracker and stracker, such as
        personal best lap times, server best lap times, players entering and leaving the server, etc.
        The message section can be detached from the other two sections, so that you can place it 
        independently on your screen.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Chat functionality</h3>
    <p><i>ptracker</i> has a chat feature built in accessable with hot keys. You can open a chat editor
    by pressing Alt&plus;T (of course you can change the keys in the configuration dialog). There are 9 
    predefined messages mapped to the number pad keys 1 to 9 (NumLock has to be enabled):
    <table class="table">
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><b>7</b> hi</td>
            <td><b>8</b> thank you!</td>
            <td><b>9</b> bye</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b>4</b> good race</td>
            <td><b>5</b> good pass</td>
            <td><b>6</b> sorry</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>      
            <td><b>1</b> :)</td>
            <td><b>2</b> :D</td>
            <td><b>3</b> :(</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    </p>
    <h3>Dialogs</h3>
    <p>Additionally, there is a dialog with more detailed information and customization. You activate this
    by either double clicking on the hotlap section or by a single click on the connection icon. The dialog
    can be closed by clicking on the icon in the top left. The dialog has the following sections:
    <ul>
        <li>
            The <b>Lap Stats</b> section shows information about the best laps achieved. The information
            is either gathered from a database on the client machine, or (if available) from <i>stracker</i>.
            The information source is indicated in the lower right. You can set various filters in this 
            dialog. You can click on a lap to get more detailed information. You can navigate through
            the ranking with the buttons on the lower screen (go to top, one page up, go to my rank, 
            one page down, go to bottom).

            </li>
        <li>Similarly, the <b>Session Stats</b> section shows information about recent sessions.</li>
        <li>The <b>Config</b> section is the central place to configure the behaviour of <i>ptracker</i>.
            You have loads of possibilities to change the behaviour.
            <img src="images/ptracker-screen-4.png" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Responsive image"> 
            </li>
        <li>The <b>Setups/Players</b> section provides an interface to share setups in various ways.
            This functionality is limited for servers running <i>stracker</i>. Server admins may also
            use this page for kicking bad drivers.</li>
        <li>The <b>Database</b> section provides an interface for controlling the local database.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Performance</h3>
    <p>During the development of ptracker, a lot of effort has been spent to make it as efficient as
       possible and to keep the in-game FPS as high as possible. This is the reason why ptracker is 
       split up into two parts, a normal python app running in the Assetto Corsa game and an exe file
       which is automatically started from the python app.</p>
    <h2>stracker</h2>
    <p>The server-side app automatically stores all laps, sessions and drivers in a database on the server.
    It can provide web pages with interesting information for access with a browser. See the 
    <a href="neys_servers"> NEYS AC server</a> statistics for an example.
    </p>
    <h3>HTML Output</h3>
    <p>
    The HTML output of stracker features the following items:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Lap Times</b>. Ranking of a track/car combination with various filters (accessable 
        by the '+' button). You can click on any lap to get more detailed information.</li>
        <li><b>Sessions</b>. History of sessions. You can click on any session to get the
        leaderboard information. Furthermore, clicking on a driver in the leaderboard provides
        you with the laps of the driver, and of course you can get the details for all the laps.</li>
        <li><b>Drivers</b>. List of all drivers seen on the server.</li>
        <li><b>Championships</b>. Championship ranking (for leagues).</li>
        <li><b>Statistics</b>. Server statistics.</li>
        <li><b>Live Map</b>. Live view of current server activity.</li>
        <li><b>Admin Area</b>. Admins can access this area for performing a number of tasks:
            <ul>
                <li>Manual lap invalidation, e.g., when there were cheaters online.</li>
                <li>Driver management (adding to banlists, etc.)</li>
                <li>Championship management.</li>
                <li>Group management.</li>
                <li>General administration.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Multiserver support</h3>
    <p>
    A lot of communities offer multiple AC servers. <i>stracker</i> supports these setups with
    flexible configuration options. You choose if you wish to keep all servers in one database,
    or have a seperate DB for each one.
    </p>
    <h3>Database backends</h3>
    <p>
    There are two database backends supported: sqlite and postgresql. While sqlite has its strengths in
    its ease of use, the postgresql database is a natural choice for larger setups. You can switch between
    these database backends at any time.
